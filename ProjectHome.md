TheKBase is a multiple-hierarchical information manager, or a "hierarchical notepad on steroids." It lets you organize information via a simple Windows Explorer-type interface with a text editor (tree on the left side, text on the right). Kbases consist of bits of information or "snippets." Each snippet has a title, text, icon, etc. Each snippet may contain one or more snippets, much like folders in a file system. The "twist" is that snippets may also be contained by more than one snippet. It's a simple concept but its applications -- academic, business, personal, social -- are limitless.
